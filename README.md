# TFLVisualisation


In this visualisation project, my goal was to create a map showcasing London Underground stations and statistics of the entries for each station.
The data collected is of 5 years of entries in the TFL (2017-22)
The initial map shows the average entry data for each station over the 5 years of available data.
The other pages are of the same data only presented differently, the second page on the visualisation is of the data but has interactivity by allowing users to change the year of the data and the user can choose whether they want to see the bar graph of the top busiest stations or the top quietest stations and the user can see this data for each year of the available data given.
The final page is the average station entries based on the 5 years of data but in a graph form rather than a map form so its more precise and visualises the data differently.




# Data Sources 

I gained all my data from these sources:
[Map and Zone colour distribution](https://www.doogal.co.uk/london_stations)
[Dataset used in Visualisation](http://crowding.data.tfl.gov.uk)

# Final Outcome
<img width="2178" height="698" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63dbaea6-3410-4c41-ab51-43b483b47768" />
This is the front page which is the map that allows users to interact by hovering over each station shown to see the entry data over 5 years.

This page allows users to see the data in a graph form and also has interactivity by allowing users to change the year of the data and whether they want to see the data for the quiesest or busiest stations in which the graph will show the top 20.

This final page shows the average entries of each station based on the 5 years of given data.




# Note
To run this It would be advised to download the necassary libraries such as poetry. Run the folder in terminal and type the code - 'poetry ryn python -m app' which should allow you to click a link to run the visualisation.
